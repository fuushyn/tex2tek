Idea: Creating LaTeX documents is often challenging and time-consuming, particularly for users with limited LaTeX knowledge. GPT-Latexifier aims to address this issue by leveraging the capabilities of GPT's API to automate LaTeX document generation, allowing users to focus on their content while minimizing the time and effort spent on formatting.
Vision: Our vision is to create an intuitive and user-friendly tool that converts natural language into LaTeX format using GPT's API capabilities, making it accessible and efficient for individuals and organizations involved in academic and technical writing.
